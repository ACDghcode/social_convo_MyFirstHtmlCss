		<h1>Entering and Exiting Conversations in Social Settings</h1>
		<img src="Conversation.jpg" alt="people talking" width="300" height="200" />
		<p>Have you ever walked into a room filled with people you don&rsquo;t 
		know and struggled to enter a conversation with someone&#63;</p>
		
		<h2>Try this computer science approach</h2>
		<h3>Entering a conversation with <b>convo.enter&#40;&#41;</b> </h3>
		<p>Call this method and pass it the following three parameters:</p>
			<ul> 
				<li>who</li>
				<li>where</li>	
				<li>what</li>
			</ul>
		<p>The first parameter&#44; who&#44 describes who you want to talk to.
		Maybe it&rsquo;s that guy over there in the blue shirt&#44; 
		or that group of people standing by the buffet table. 
		The second parameter is where. The where parameter describes where you are.
		Are you in a banquet room&#63; Are you in a park&#63;	
		Finally the what parameter describes what you intend to say.</p>
  		<p>Let&rsquo;s say you are attending a crowded poetry slam and there is a break 
		in the program. You approach a group of people standing at the bar 
		waiting to order drinks and you want to talk to them. 
		As you walk over to the group you may call <b>convo.enter&#40;&#41;</b> 
		and pass it three parameters separated by commas. </p>
		<p>For example&#58; </p>
		<p><b>convo.enter&#40;group at bar, poetry slam, that last poet was pretty good&#41;</b></p>
  
		<h3>Exiting a conversation with convo.exit&#40;&#41; </h3>
		<p>Imagine you have gotten your drink and you are ready to get back 
		to your table to enjoy the rest of the show. You don&rsquo;t want to be rude 
		to the great of people you have just met, but your friends are waiting for you 
		and you really need to exit this conversation.Call <b>convo.exit&#40;&#41;</b> 
		and pass it three parameters. The first two parameters, who and where, 
		are the same. You will need to change the third parameter. 
		What will you say to make a graceful exit&#63; Here is an example. 
		<b>convo.exit(group at bar, poetry slam, have a great night). </b>
		Then simply walk back to your table!</p>
